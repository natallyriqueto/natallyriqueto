I'm a Software Engineer with five years of professional experience. I have honed my skills creating web applications and restful API's. I've explored many technologies working on differents projects.

### üöÄ Expertise
Throughout my five years of experience, I have worked on different projects, focusing on developing responsive and user-friendly frontend applications. My expertise lies in some frontend technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Angular.
In addition to my frontend experience, I have also gained valuable experience in building RESTful APIs using Node.js.
